# Genetic-Algorithm-String-Builder
Genetic Algorithm to build the user-defined string from a population of random strings

Prompts user to enter a string
Generates a population of random strings using the first 128 unicode characters.
Compares each random string to the user-defined target string and calculates its fitness (number of matching characters)
Mates the fittest strings to create the next generation
Mutates strings with some probability
Iterates until the target string is built
